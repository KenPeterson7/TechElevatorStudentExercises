getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee

Expected output:
2, since we are returning a list by employee_id and employee_id 1 has 2 timesheets

Actual output:
1, since the method contains an if statement

How did you fix this bug?
Change the IF statement to a WHILE loop

Test that demonstrates problem: # 7
updated_timesheet_has_expected_values_when_retrieved

Expected output:
The updated values for timesheet_id 3 are employee_id, project_id, date_worked, hours_worked, billable, and description are equal to the
retrieved values for all timesheet_id 3

Actual output:
No value specified for parameter error (billable)

Added billable = ? to the select statement, and added updatedTimesheet.isBillable() to the jdbcTemplate update method

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getBillableHours_returns_correct_total

0, because the getBillableHours method should not return the hours if the billable boolean is false

Actual output:
2,  because the method was the method did not account for billable in the Where condition.

How did you fix this bug?
added and billable = true; to the where condition
